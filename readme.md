# This is a basic django app I built
It's a super simple calculator app that does basic operations and keeps a history of previous calculations in a SQLite database. 
I run it locally, by first calling `python manage.py runserver` and then navigating to `localhost:8000\calc` 
The front-end is built using the Bootstrap Framework

TODO:
* Make button position/spacing a bit nicer.
* Clean up source code and add documentaiton (e.g. docheaders)
* Fix homepage 
* Maybe add jquery to make a more dynamic frontend? I might save that for next project
